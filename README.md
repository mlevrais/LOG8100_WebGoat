# WEBGOAT Application - Project

## Deployment

### Configure K8s cluster locally with Minikube

#### Starting Minikube

Start Docker Desktop, then start Minikube to create a VM and a Kubernetes cluster on that machine with the following command:

```
minikube start --driver=docker
```

If starting Minikube fails, try deleting with this command and retry again:

```
minikube delete
```

You can run this command to check the Minikube status

```
minikube status
```

#### Configure cluster

In your terminal, go to the `terraform` directory

```
cd ./terraform
```

In `variables.tfvars`, set the path to your `.kube/config` folder. It is where Kubernetes store its config files. On Windows, usually its `$env:userprofile/.kube/config`.
So in a powershell terminal, type `$env:userprofile` to get the first part of the path. If you are using `\` in the path, make sure to escape it with `\\`.
Then initialize Terraform

```
terraform init
```

Then apply the tf files to configure the cluster

```
terraform apply -var-file="variables.tfvars"
```

### Confirming that the cluster is configured
Use the following command to make sure the cluster is configured. You should see the namespace `webgoat`.

```
kubectl get namespaces
```

### Configure K8s cluster on Kubernetes

#### Requirements:

- Before configuring the cluster, you need to register an application on Azure and obtain a secret so that Terraform can automate the creation of the cluster on your behalf.
- Azure CLI version 2.30.0 or higher

Then, in your terminal, go to the `terraform` directory

```
cd ./terraform
```

**Optional** In `variables.tfvars`, set:

```
appId = "<YOUR APP ID>"
password = "<YOUR APP SECRET>"
```

If you are running Terraform for the first time, intialize Terraform:

```
terraform init
```

If you updated the `variables.tfvars` file, apply the tf files to configure the cluster :

```
terraform apply -var-file="variables.tfvars"
```

Or if you want to enter the app ID and secret from the command line:

```
terraform apply
```
